The Merlin's Herbal Roots Shipping Site is a web interface to a database of
shipping information for Merlin's clients.

The database is stored on a public server, and the web interface makes
queries to the database in real time using an AJAX protocol.

The Database
------------
The database stores the set of all transactions that go through Merlin's
Herbal Magic.  Transactions indicate any of:

    * An order being placed and paid for by a customer
    * An order being shipped
    * A delivery of supplies coming in

All transactions are marked with a timestamp and a field for
miscellaneous notes.

The database also keeps track of the current inventory of supplies.

An order placement transaction has the following data:

    * The customer placing the order
    * The types and quantity of products ordered
    * The shipping address
    * The amount the customer paid

A shipped order transaction has only a reference to the placement
transaction.

A delivery order has the quantity of supples delivered.

We store the following information on each customer:

    * Name
    * Address
    * Miscellaneous notes

The products available are:

    * Bags of herbal root mix
    * Jars of herbal root mix
    * Travel packs
    * Tuning forks


The Web Interface
-----------------
The web interface is a simple navigation bar layout.  The pages
available are:

    * Enter transaction
    * Search transactions
    * Search customers
    * Pending orders

The enter transaction page is a simple nested-table layout for entering
any transaction into the database.  The timestamp field is always set to
the current time. 

The search transactions page shows the standard representation of a
transaction with a dropdown in place of each element.  The dropdown text
starts empty, but when you click on it, it shows a list of constraint
types, depending on the type of field.  When you select a constraint,
an appropriate UI appears for specifying the parameters of that
constraint, and another empty dropdown appears below it.  All constraints 
are ANDed together.  For nested data and references, another blank table
UI for that type counts as a constraint.

Below this example transaction, in real time, the first several search
results are displayed, from newest to oldest.

The search customers page works exactly the same was as the search
transactions page, except that it searches the customers table.

Pending orders shows a list of all the order placement transactions that
do not have a corresponding order shipped transaction.

Search constraints
------------------

For numeric fields:

    * Greater than some number.
    * Less than some number.
    * Equal to some number.

For timestamp:

    * Before, some date.
    * After, some date.

For name, address, and misc. notes fields:

    * Contains some text.

For record/tuple types, show the standard table interface with
constraints for each of the parameters.  This interface does not
duplicate itself below.

For types with multiple options, show an unselected radio button for
each type.  When one of the types is selected, show its constraint
interface.  This interface does not duplicate itself below when an
option is selected, like most constraint interfaces do.
